## Visualize_Results folder includes MATLAB code to apply statistical masks and visualize the resulting functional connectivity matrices from the AnalysisPipeline step.

The fsaverage folder contains the MATLAB files for the fsaverage surface-based template with several smoothing values. 

The results folder has group-level connectivity matrices from the AnalysisPipeline step. We could not upload all connectivity matrices due to limits on the file size but provided some examples to run the code.

The scripts folder has the code for this part. A detailed explanation is provided in its ReadMe.md file.
